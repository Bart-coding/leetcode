# 1232. Check If It Is a Straight Line
You are given an array **coordinates** representing 2D points, where for each coordinates pair **coordinates[i]** there is its **x** coordinate in coordinates[i][0] and its **y** coordinate in coordinates[i][1].\
Return **true** if these points can make a straight line in the XY plane. Otherwise, return **false**.
