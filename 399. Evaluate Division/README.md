## Evaluate division of two given variables basing on the given data
* equations[i] = [Ai, Bi] (string values) and values[i] (floats) represent the equation Ai / Bi = values[i]
* queries[j] = [Cj, Dj] represents j-th query to evaluate division Cj / Dj
* if query Cj / Dj cannot be resolved, then return -1.0
