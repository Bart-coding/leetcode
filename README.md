## My solutions to algorithmic tasks from the Leetcode website implemented in various programming languages.
All relevant rights for tasks highlighted in this repo belong to Leetcode. <br>
I do not claim credit for all the code presented here, pieces of code may come from other sources (available solutions of other people and bots). However, the above solutions are, of course, largely the result of my thinking and searching :)
